# Portfolio
Portfolio Website
In addition to the ReactJS library, my portolio websites is constructed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website contains four pages: Home, About, Projects, and Resume. Home page has a headhsot, introduction, and download button for my resume. About has a photograph, introductory paragraph, and skills. Projects has photographs/videos of projects, their name, descriptive bullets, and skills involved. Resume is an embedded iframe. The website along with footer and navbar will alter form to accommodate screen size.
